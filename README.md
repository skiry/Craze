# Craze
This is a team project which, in a nutshell, it is similar to ‘Waze’, but helps people find spaces / places / apartments to rent.  

From the user’s POV, the application:  
* Provides a map interface to allow easier location of places of interest (to rent)  
* Allows regular users to take notes of particular places (e.g. in this area, people usually are drilling their walls 9-5)  
* Allows regular users to filter through areas, by certain criteria (e.g., this user likes quiet places, so all places that are marked as noisy are filtered out by default.)  
* The filtering can be done via some tags that the user wants / does not want or based on a specific location via a pin with a radius chosen by the user.
